<h1>Art for Art's sake</h1>
<p>On this webpage we will be looking at some of the art piece's in the new exibit Art for Art's sake.<br> The exibit will be focused on art with optical illusion and art that will make you see pictures move.</p>
<img src="illsion-1.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>
<p>This picture is one of the optical illusion, when you look at one circle it seems the other ones spin even though it is a still image.</p>
<img src="illusion art-1.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt=""/>
<p>This illusion is simillar to the last one, if you look a the middle of the circle the oustide rim spins.</p>
<img src="illisoin spinnin.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt=""/><br>
<p>This image has spirals that spin in you see them in your peripheral vision.</p>
<img src="spin.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt=""/>
<p>This image seems like a spinning room, due to the pilliar in the middle of it tricking your brain.</p>
<img src="dost.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt=""/>
<p>When looking at one dot the others are black, but the one you are directly are white, if you look at a diffrent do the other one becomes white.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at a few images from our new Galary Art for Arts sake.</p>
